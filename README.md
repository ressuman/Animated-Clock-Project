# JavaScript in Web Browsers

## üéØ Objectives

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of basic JavaScript concepts such as variables, functions, and objects. I will also learn how to use JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and create interactive web pages.

## ‚úÖ Task: Animated Clock

- Open the `animated-clock` folder in VS Code and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
- You should see a clock with a second hand, minute hand, and hour hand.
- My task is to make the clock animated so that the hands move in real time.
- I can also try to incorporate the ticking sound effect from the media folder.
- For this task, I will need to edit just the script.js file.
